It’s been an epic few days for World of Warcraft, including the announcement of the Battle for Azeroth expansion at BlizzCon, but there’s one more announcement we didn’t get to: when you’ll be able to enter Antorus, the Burning Throne. &#13;

Hey all!&#13;
&#13;
After careful deliberation and debate, we were able to sift through the amazing submissions by talented World of Warcraft community members and identify three Grand Prize Winners and ten runners-up in the Shadows of Argus Art Contest.&#13;
&#13;
You can check out the winning entries here.
